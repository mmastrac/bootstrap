# Third stage bootstrap
# Line prefix determines behavior:
#   '#': Comment
#   ':': Set write address to hex 'abcd'
#   'tab': Assemble chars until a newline
#   'newline': Blank line, skipped
#
# Implements an assembler that supports two-pass labels (8-char long only)

# TODO:
#   - Avoid using so many registers (future planned register symbol 
#     re-allocation) - maybe a lookup func?
#		- =$x symb / call would look up "symb"
#   - Use a malloc-like function instead of hardcoding table addresses
