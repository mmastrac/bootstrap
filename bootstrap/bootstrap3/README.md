# Assembly

## Calling convention

  - Argument registers (`r0`-`r7`) are not preserved across calls (caller-saved)
  - Return values provided in r0 (32-bit) or r0+r1 (64-bit)
  - Temporary registers (`r55`-`r58`) are not preserved across calls (caller-saved)
  - `r59` is a compiler temporary used for compound operations
  - `r60` is the stack pointer
  - `r61` is the program counter
  - All other registers must be restored to state before call

## Macros

Macros are prefixed with `%` to indicate that they are "local-variable" aware. `call` and `ret` both have non-macro versions that are not local-aware. If `ret` is used in the scope of a global label that uses `%local` or `%arg`, the compiler will throw an error.

| Macro | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `%call` `[args...]` | Saves the current PC to the stack, calls the function placing args in `r0`-`r7` | `%call :strlen @mystring`  |
| `%tailcall` `[args...]` | Replaces the current stack frame with another function (equivalent to `%call` + `%ret`) | `%tailcall :strlen @mystring`  |
| `%ret` `[register]` | Returns from a function, popping off any saved `%local`s or `%arg`s | `%ret r0` |
| `%local` `[name...]` | Allocates local register(s), saving the previous value to the stack | `%local x, y` |
| `%arg` `[name...]` | Allocates argument register(s), saving the previous value to the stack and copying the argument value to it | `%arg x, y` |


## Linker symbols/macros

:__END__ Points to the end of the binary in memory
@__LOCALS_SIZE__ Equal to size of locals on stack
